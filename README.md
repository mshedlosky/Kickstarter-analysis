# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to deliver an analysis to Louise regarding Kickstarter campaigns. There are two areas of focus within this analysis: 1. Theater Kickstarters with respect to launch date and funding goals, and 2. Plays with respect to outcomes. 
## Analysis and Challenge
The analysis started by utilizing a larger Kickstarter data set as the primary source. This larger data set included information about Kickstarters throughout multiple countries, years, and areas of interest.

The first step of the analysis was intended to understand the Theater outcomes based on launch date. A pivot chart table was created by using the larger Kickstarter data set on a subsequent tab within the Kickstarter Challenge workbook. The new tab was titled Theater Outcomes by Launch Date. The table created by placing Parent Category and Years within the filter section, while the Rows section contained Date Created Conversion. Lastly, both the columns section and the values section contained Outcomes.

multiple steps wherein a larger dataset was utilized to create images and draw subsequent conclusions regarding the results.
